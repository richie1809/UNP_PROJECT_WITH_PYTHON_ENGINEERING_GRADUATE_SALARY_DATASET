# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_ENGINEERING_GRADUATE_SALARY_DATASET

Completed this project as a part of Python Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).
Dataset Name
Engineering Graduate Salaries Dataset

Key Highlights:
~Developed a salary prediction model for engineering graduates.
~Explored algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting, and KNN.
~Analyzed factors like education background, psychological traits, and domain-specific skills.
~KNN achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models.
~Facilitates better salary structuring and alignment with industry needs.
